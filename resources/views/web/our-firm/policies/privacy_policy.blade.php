                <p><em>Information that we collect automatically</em></p>
                <p>Our web servers may log information such as your device type, operating system type, browser
                    type, domain, the website from which you were referred to our Sites (if any), and other
                    system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country, city, and time
                    zone where your device is located. The web server logs may also record information such as
                    the address of the web page that referred you to our Sites and the IP address of the device
                    you use to connect to the Internet. They may also log information about your interaction
                    with the Sites, such as which pages you visit. To control which web servers collect
                    information by automated means, we may place tags called “web beacons” – small files that
                    link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies. We may also collect information
                    from your browser, such as your browsing history on the Sites, and use it in conjunction
                    with data gathered from forms and emails to help understand and respond to your needs. See
                    our <a href="privacy-policy/cookie-policy.html" target="_blank">Cookie Policy</a> for more
                    information.</p>
                <p><em>“Do Not Track” Signals</em></p>
                <p>Your browser settings may allow you to transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and
                    online services you visit. Like many other websites and online services, we do not currently
                    process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals from your browser or to other mechanisms that
                    enable choice.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Both we and our service providers who provide the technology platforms which support elements
                    of the Services (e.g., video clips) may collect personal information about our visitors’ use
                    of the Services online.&nbsp; Other than collection of information as described in this
                    Privacy Policy, we will not collect personal information about you when you use the Sites or
                    the Services, unless you choose to directly provide such information to us when contacting
                    us via email or other method.&nbsp; We will use your personal information to process your
                    request and, when applicable, respond to you.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>In addition to collecting information directly from you, we may collect information from
                    third- party sources to satisfy our due diligence obligations in connection with your new
                    account opening.&nbsp; This third-party data allows us to verify the information you have

                    laws.</p>
                <p><strong>Sensitive data</strong></p>

                        of interest.&nbsp; This includes tailored product, thought leadership, and event
                        communications.</li>
                    <li>To manage and improve the Sites and assess their usage and effectiveness;</li>
                    <li>To develop our business and to inform our marketing strategy, in particular, by

                    <li>To assess the usage of the Services we provide;</li>
                    <li>To operate our business in accordance with industry standards and applicable law, which

                </div>
                <p>We use the personal information for the purposes described above because we have a legitimate

                    rights and freedoms to protect personal information about you.&nbsp; We will only send you
                    direct marketing materials if you have given consent for us to do so, unless such consent is
                    not required, in which case you will be provided the opportunity to opt-out of receipt of
                    direct marketing materials.</p>
                <p><em>Information that we collect automatically</em></p>
                <p>We use certain limited personal information that we collect automatically through cookies,
                    non-cookie-based tokens, web beacons, and other automated means for purposes such as
                    customizing and enhancing our visitors’ experience on the Sites, facilitating use of the
                    Sites, collecting statistics about your visits to the Sites, and understanding the way in
                    which our visitors browse the Sites. We also use the information to help diagnose technical
                    and service problems, administer the Sites, and, in some cases, to identify visitors to the
                    Sites who are subscribed to receive communications from us. We use clickstream data to
                    determine how much time visitors spend on web pages of the Sites, how visitors navigate the
                    Sites, and how we may tailor the Sites to better meet the needs of our visitors. We use the
                    personal information for the purposes described above because we have a legitimate interest
                    in operating and improving our Sites that is not overridden by your interests, rights and
                    freedoms to protect personal information about you.&nbsp; See our <a

                <p>We also collect personal information when you engage with our email communications.&nbsp;
                    This includes email open and click information, and any responses submitted to our event
                    communications.&nbsp; We use personal information for these purposes because we have a
                    legitimate interest in growing our business and developing our marketing strategy. See our

                <p><em>Other uses of your personal information</em></p>
                <p>We also may use the personal information that we collect to protect against and prevent
                    fraud, claims, and other liabilities and to comply with or enforce applicable legal
                    requirements, industry standards, and our policies and terms.&nbsp; We use personal
                    information for these purposes when it is necessary to protect, exercise or defend our legal
                    rights, or when we are required to do so by law that applies to us.</p>
                <p><em>Mobile Phone Information</em></p>
                <p>In connection with certain of our products and services, we may authenticate instructions
                    which purport to come from you by calling back a telephone number which you have previously
                    provided to us.&nbsp; By providing us with a mobile phone number for call back purposes, or
                    by submitting an instruction, you authorize (on behalf of yourself and any Authorized
                    Person) that the appropriate carrier (AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, Verizon or
                    any other branded operator) may disclose to us and our third-party service providers the
                    mobile number, network status, customer type, customer’s role, billing type, mobile device
                    identifiers (IMSI [International Mobile Subscriber Identity] and IMEI [International Mobile
                    Equipment Identifier]) and other subscriber status and device details, if available, solely
                    to verify the caller’s identity and prevent fraud for the duration of the relationship.
                    &nbsp;Please note that this information is used only as part of the call back procedure to
                    verify your instruction, and this information is not retained by us after completion of the

                    (ii) to our internal or external auditors or attorneys; (iii) when we believe disclosure is
                    necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss; (iv) if we are required
                    or permitted to do so by law or legal process, for example due to a court order or a request
                    from a law enforcement agency; (v) if disclosure is necessary to protect the vital interests
                    of a person; or (vi) in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or

                <p><strong>How we transfer and store personal information</strong></p>
                <p>WAML is a global organization; personal information we collect may be transferred
                    internationally throughout the world to countries where we do business, which may not have
                    the same data protection laws as the country in which you reside. We have internal policies
                    and procedures in place to achieve an equivalent level of protection in place across our
                    organization. The transfer of personal information to other countries is based on a business
                    need or to comply with applicable laws. Personal information stored or processed in a
                    foreign jurisdiction may be accessed under a lawful order made in that jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>If you are in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom or Switzerland, we will
                    comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of

                    <li>Personal information collected for analytics purposes: we keep this personal information
                        for a short period of time necessary for us to carry out the analytics. We anonymize or
                        aggregate personal information used for analytics once it is no longer required.</li>
                    <li>Website logs: we keep audit logs for our Sites, which may contain your personal

                <p><strong>4. Specific Rights under the CCPA</strong></p>
                <p>Under the CCPA, California residents have certain specific rights with respect to their
                    personal information.&nbsp; The following describes these rights:</p>
                <p><em>Right to Request Information</em></p>
                <p>You have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, that we disclose to you the
                    personal information we have collected, used, disclosed and sold about you during the past
                    12 months.</p>
                <p><em>Right to Request Deletion of Personal Information</em></p>
                <p>You also have the right to request that we delete certain personal information that we have
                    collected from you.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><em>Opt-Out of Sale</em></p>
                <p><em>You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information. </em>As noted in
                    our main Privacy Policy, we do not sell any personal information, including but not limited
                    to personal information of minors under sixteen (16) years of age.</p>
                <p><em>How to Exercise Your Rights</em></p>
                <p>We offer three methods by which you may submit a request for information or for deletion of
                    your personal information:</p>
                <ol class="rte--list">
                    <li>You may submit a request using the <a href="privacy-policy/personal-information-request.html"
                            target="_blank">dedicated
                            request form</a> on our website: (<a
                            href="https://www.wgaml.com/en-us/our-firm/policies-and-disclosures/privacy-policy/personal-information-request">https://www.wgaml.com/en-us/our-firm/policies-and-disclosures/privacy-policy/personal-information-request</a>);<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>You may submit a request via email to <a
                            href="mailto:globalprivacy@wgaml.com">globalprivacy@wgaml.com</a>; or<br></li>
                    <li>You may call us toll-free at +852 5808 6078 and ask to speak to the WAML Privacy
                        Officer.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Please note that for us to act on your request, we must verify that you are the individual to
                    whom the request relates.&nbsp; The procedure for verifying your request will vary depending
                    on the nature of your request and your relationship with us but will typically involve
                    requiring you to provide us with two or more pieces of identifying information matching your
                    personal information already in our records. In addition, if you ask us to provide you with
                    specific pieces of personal information, we may require you to sign a declaration under
                    penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of
                    the request.&nbsp; We will notify you if we are unable to verify your request as required by
                    the CCPA.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>To submit a request as an authorized agent on behalf of an individual, you must provide us
                    with written and signed permission from the individual to submit requests on their behalf,
                    in addition to any other information which would be necessary if the individual were making
                    the request directly.</p>
                <p><em>Right of Non-Discrimination</em></p>
                <p>We will not discriminate against you because you have exercised any of your rights under the
                    CCPA.&nbsp; This includes, but is not limited to, denying you goods or services, charging
                    you different prices or rates for goods or services, providing you with a different level or
                    quality of goods or services, or suggesting that you will receive a different price or rate
                    for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services because you have
                    exercised any of your rights under the CCPA.</p>
                <p></p>
