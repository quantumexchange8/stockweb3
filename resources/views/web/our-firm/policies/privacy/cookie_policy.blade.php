            <p><em>What are Cookies and similar technologies?</em></p>
            <p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information downloaded to your computer or
                device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating site on each
                subsequent visit, or to another site that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are useful because
                they allow a site to recognize a user’s device.</p>
            <p>Cookies do a lot of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently,
                remembering your preferences, and they generally improve the user experience. They can also
                help to ensure that on websites featuring advertisements, the advertisements you see online
                are more relevant to you and your interests.&nbsp; Please note that the Sites do not contain
                advertisements or use advertising Cookies.</p>
            <p>Some of the Cookies we use are for web analytics and intelligence about our Sites. They help
                us learn which areas of our Sites are useful and which areas need improvement. For this
                purpose, we may also use web beacons or other similar technologies in marketing email
                messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and
                links clicked on. Unlike Cookies, web beacons do not place information on your device, but
                may work in conjunction with Cookies to record site activity.</p>
            <p>You can choose whether to accept the use of Cookies and similar technologies in general by
                changing the settings on your browser.&nbsp; For more information on how to do this, please
                visit our Managing Cookies page. &nbsp;However, if you disable Cookies and similar
                technologies, your experience on the Sites may be diminished and some features may not work
                as intended.</p>
            <p>You can find more information about Cookies and similar technologies at: <a
                    href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/" class="disclaimer-toggle">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and <a

            </p>
            <p><em>Who sets Cookies?</em></p>
            <p>Cookies may be set by our Sites or by another site prior to or during your visit to our
                Sites. These are known as ‘first party’ and ‘third party’ Cookies.</p>
            <p>First party Cookies belong to the website domain that appears in the browser address bar.</p>
            <p>Third-party Cookies belong to website domains different from the one shown in the address
                bar. Certain of our service providers who provide the technology platforms which support
                elements of the Services (for example, video clips) may also set Cookies on your device
                during a visit to one of our Sites. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em>How long do Cookies last?</em></p>
            <p>Cookies can be placed either for an individual "session" or on a "persistent" basis.</p>
            <p>"Session Cookies” are temporary and will expire at the end of a browser session; that is,
                when you leave a website. Session Cookies allow a website to recognize you and carry
                information as you navigate between pages during a single browser session and allow you to
                use the website efficiently.</p>
            <p>"Persistent Cookies" remain in the file of your browser even after you leave a website and
                after the browser is closed. These Cookies remain valid until their set expiry date (unless
                deleted by the user before the expiry date). These Cookies allow a website to collect and
                analyze (on an anonymous basis) traffic and use of the website, monitor the system and
                improve operating performance. For example, they enable a website to recognize you on your
                return, remember your preferences and provide tailored services to you.</p>
            <p><em>Cookies used on our Sites</em></p>
            <p>Below we list the different types of Cookies and similar technologies used on our Sites. To
                the extent any personal information, such as IP address, is collected through Cookies, our
                Privacy Policy applies and complements this Cookie Policy.&nbsp; The Cookies used on our
                Sites have been categorized on the basis of the categories found in the International
                Chamber of Commerce UK Cookie guide issued in April 2012.</p>
            <p>(1) <strong>Strictly necessary Cookies</strong> - These Cookies are essential in order to
                enable you to move around the site and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of
                the site. Without these Cookies the Services cannot be provided.</p>
            <p>We categorize the following Cookie as strictly necessary:&nbsp;</p>
            <div style="padding-left: 30px;">
                <li>Registered Visitor Cookie for INFUSE, our client portal - If a visitor to our Site logs
                    into INFUSE, our secure client portal, the Site will place the ID cookie on the user’s
                    computer to uniquely identify the user throughout the user’s interaction with
                    INFUSE.&nbsp; This cookie expires twenty-four (24) hours after it is issued, or when the
                    user logs out from the portal or closes their browser.&nbsp; The INFUSE portal will not
                    operate without this cookie.</li>
            </div>
            <p>(2) <strong>Performance Cookies</strong> - These Cookies collect information about how
                visitors use a site, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get
                error messages from web pages. These Cookies don't collect information that identifies a
                visitor. All information these Cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how
                a site works.</p>
            <p>We categorize the following as performance Cookies:</p>
            <div style="padding-left: 30px;">

                    understand what URLs are referring visitors.</li>
                <li>URL History - Used to store the page visited by a user before that user submits a form.

                    analysis on how unregistered visitors use our site.</li>
                <li>Session Management Cookies - These Cookies allow us to follow the actions of a user
                    during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window
                    and finishes when they close their browser window. Our session management Cookies are
                    created temporarily. Once you close your browser, our session management Cookies are
                    deleted.<br></li>
            </div>
            <p><strong>(3) Functionality Cookies </strong>- These Cookies allow a site to remember choices
                you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced,
                more personal features. For instance, a site may be able to provide you with local
                information by storing in a Cookie the region in which you are currently located. These
                Cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, font and other
                parts of web pages that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you
                have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. Subject to applicable legal
                restrictions, we may use information collected from our Cookies to identify user behavior
                and to serve content and information on products and services based on your profile. We may

                provided your contact information to us and are opening or clicking on a link in an email
                which you have received from us.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>These Cookies cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. They don’t gather any
                information about you that could be used for advertising or remembering where you’ve been on
