        <h2>Data Protection Notice</h2>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            This notice is to make you aware of how the personal data that you provide to Wingate is processed. In this
            notice, “WAML” means one or more of the following Wingate entities with which you are contracted: Wingate
            Trustee Services (Ireland) Limited, Wingate Fund Administration Services (Ireland) Limited, Wingate Investor
            Services Limited (UK), Wingate (Luxembourg) S.C.A.
            <br><br>
            WAML as Data Controller processes personal data in compliance with General Data Protection Regulation
            (EU/2016/679) (“GDPR”).
            <br><br>
            As a client which provides WAML with the personal data of individuals associated with you in connection with
            your business relationship with us, the information in this notice is relevant to such individuals, and we
            request that you make this information available to them.
            <br><br>
            By continuing to provide us with personal data, you confirm that:

        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
            1. All personal data that you provide to WAML has been collected, processed and provided to WAML in
            compliance with applicable laws, including the GDPR; <br>
            2. All such personal data is accurate, relevant, limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which
            you <br>
            3. provide it, and, as applicable, up-to-date; and
            When you provide personal data to WAML for the express purpose of being forwarded to a jurisdiction that
            does not have equivalent protections for personal data as those in the EU, you have informed the
            relevant individuals whose personal data you are providing to us in accordance with GDPR and obtained
            specific, unambiguous and freely given consent from them.
        </p>

        permitted by applicable law.
        <br><br>
        The legal bases upon which WAML will process personal data are WAML’s legitimate interest in operating its
        business and to comply with laws, rules and regulations to which WAML is subject.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Recipients of Personal Data</strong>
