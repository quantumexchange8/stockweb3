            <strong>Be aware of potential threats</strong>
            <br><br>
            To protect your information, it is important to be vigilant to the potential threats that exist today. Cyber
            criminals looking to obtain confidential and/or personal information from an individual or company often
            employ deceptive techniques to “trick” people into readily handing over such information (i.e., phishing) or
            unwittingly opening themselves up for security attacks (i.e., spoofing). These techniques can include, but
            are not limited to, emails appearing to be from legitimate sources, internet “pop-ups”, and online
            advertisements hiding malicious viruses or malware, fake websites, etc.
            <br><br>
            In today’s world, it is critical to be cautious when accessing and sharing your personal and confidential
            information online and in your daily interactions. The following are some important considerations to be
            mindful of while performing your daily business and personal routines:

            suspect you may have received a suspicious Vanward link or Vanward email you may call your Vanward Relationship
            Manager or contact Vanward at any of our main locations.
            <br><br>

            ever contact you on an unsolicited basis (by telephone, email or otherwise) and request that you provide
            your logon credentials, electronic banking or other personal information.
            <br><br>
            Do not share personal information with anyone whom you are not familiar with or trust.
            <br><br>
            Access your accounts regularly and monitor activity for possible fraud.
            <br><br>

            in their environments periodically in accordance with their institutions applicable programs.
            <br><br>
