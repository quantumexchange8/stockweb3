            Be aware of potential threats, steps you can take to protect yourself, staying informed and reporting Fraud
            or Suspicious Activity to Wingate ("WAML").
            <br><br>
            At WAML, the security of our client’s information is paramount. As part of our Information Security Program,
            we employ technology and processes to protect our clients’ information. However, there are steps you can
            take to help further protect your information.
            <br><br>
            The purpose of this page is to provide you with suggestions regarding actions that you can take to ensure
            the protection of your information.
            <br><br>
            Be aware of potential threats
            <br><br>
            To protect your information, it is important to be vigilant to the potential threats that exist today. Cyber
            criminals looking to obtain confidential and/or personal information from an individual or company often
            employ deceptive techniques to “trick” people into readily handing over such information (i.e., phishing) or
            unwittingly opening themselves up for security attacks (i.e., spoofing). These techniques can include, but
            are not limited to, emails appearing to be from legitimate sources, internet “pop-ups”, and online
            advertisements hiding malicious viruses or malware, fake websites, etc.
            <br><br>
            In today’s world, it is critical to be cautious when accessing and sharing your personal and confidential
            information online and in your daily interactions. The following are some important considerations to be
            mindful of while performing your daily business and personal routines:
            <br><br>
            WAML's website address is https://www.wgaml.com. All legitimate communications from WAML will come from a
            wgaml.com domain. All others should be considered suspect. If you have any questions about WAML's website or
            suspect you may have received a suspicious WAML link or WAML email you may call your WAML Relationship
            Manager or contact WAML at any of our main locations.
            <br><br>
            Be cautious of any emails requesting personal or confidential information. Under no circumstances will WAML
            ever contact you on an unsolicited basis (by telephone, email or otherwise) and request that you provide
            your logon credentials, electronic banking or other personal information.
            <br><br>
            Do not share personal information with anyone whom you are not familiar with or trust.
            <br><br>
            Access your accounts regularly and monitor activity for possible fraud.
            <br><br>
            Institutional banking clients should perform information security risk assessments of the related controls
            in their environments periodically in accordance with their institutions applicable programs.
            <br><br>
            Not all public Wi-Fi networks are secure, especially in café's, hotels and airports. Learn what to look for
            and how to protect yourself when using these networks.
            <br><br>
            Steps you can take to protect yourself
            <br><br>
            In addition to being aware of potential online security threats, there are several steps that can be taken
            to enhance the security of computer, network or personal devices. Below are some points to consider for
            protecting the integrity of personal and confidential information on these devices. For additional
            information, please refer to the Stay Informed section below.
            <br><br>
            For all internet capable devices, refer to your device's security protocols for a complete list of security
            related options, and consider the following:
            <br><br>
            Securing the Computer
            <br><br>
            Enable automatic updates on security software
            Enable personal firewalls as a protective barrier between the user and the internet
            Operating systems should be updated to the latest version
            Patches from the vendor should be updated on a regular basis
            Web browsers should be updated on a regular basis
            Web browsers should be configured to use the strongest encryption available
            Virus protection and anti-spyware software should be installed and updated regularly
            Periodic full scans should be performed
            Where possible, access to the device should be limited to only the required individuals
            Securing Wireless Networks
            <br><br>
            Wireless networks should be configured to use the strongest encryption available and password protected
            Older, out dated wireless equipment should be replaced with newer, more secure models
            Default router names and default passwords that were assigned by the manufacturer should be changed during
            installation
            Wireless networks should be disabled if they are not going to be used for long periods of time
            Securing Personal and Confidential Information
            <br><br>
            Where possible, passwords should be complex and unique to each individual account
            Passwords should be kept secure and not shared with anyone
            Sharing personal and confidential information should be limited to trusted individuals and should only be
            provided as required via secure websites
            The transmission of personal and confidential information in an email should be limited as most email
            systems are not secure
            Important files should be backed up on a regular basis
            Always "logout" of online sessions when exiting to ensure the session is completely terminated -simply
            closing the browser may not terminate the sessions completely
            Securing Mobile Devices
            <br><br>
            Enable the password lock functionality
            Enable idle timeout to automatically lock the device when not in use
            Operating systems and installed applications should be kept up to date
            Where possible, encrypt data residing on personal devices
            If disposing of a personal device, all personal data should be permanently deleted from the device's data
            storage media
            Simply deleting the file names may not permanently remove the data so use the device's wipe features, or
            look for products designed to prepare a device for disposal
            <br><br>
            <strong>Stay Informed</strong>
            <br><br>
            There are many resources available online that provide information and tips about staying secure while on
            the internet. Take the time and stay informed.
