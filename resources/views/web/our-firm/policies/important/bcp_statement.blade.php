            Wingate's ("WAML") Business Continuity Planning Program is a comprehensive and ongoing initiative that
            encompasses various measures to ensure the continuity of our operations. These include implementing
            preventative measures, conducting ongoing risk management, developing recovery plans for all business units
            and systems, testing the plans, providing BCP training to senior management, business unit planners, and
            employees, as well as fostering safety awareness and effective event management.
            <br><br>
            Our Business Continuity Planning program encompasses scenario-based plans that address a range of events,
            including natural risks, technology risks, and human risks. This approach enables us to effectively manage
            business interruptions of different scales and impacts by leveraging geographically dispersed staff,
            alternative processing locations, and redundant infrastructure. We conduct regular and extensive testing of
            our BCP arrangements to ensure their effectiveness.
            <br><br>
            While it is impossible to guarantee uninterrupted service, WAML is well-positioned to maintain a high level
            of client service during any interruption. For detailed information about our Business Continuity Planning
            Program, please reach out to your Relationship Manager, who will be able to provide you with further
            details.
