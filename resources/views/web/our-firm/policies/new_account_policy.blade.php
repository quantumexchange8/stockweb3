            <strong>Important Information About Procedures for Opening a New Account</strong>
            <br><br>
            To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires
            all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens
            an account. Therefore, when you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and
            other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also request copies of identification
            documents.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Notice to Commercial Account Holders</strong>
            <br><br>
            If you are a commercial customer, please be advised that you are prohibited from engaging in any activity or
            business that is unlawful under the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, 31 USC 5361, et
            seq., (the "UIGEA"). You may not use your account or any other service we offer to receive any funds
            transfer, credit, instrument or proceeds that arise out of a business that is unlawful under the UIGEA. If
            anyone asks us to process a transaction that we believe is restricted under the UIGEA, we may block the
            transaction and take any other action we deem to be reasonable under the UIGEA.
