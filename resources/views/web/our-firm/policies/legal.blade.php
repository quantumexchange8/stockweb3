            These WAML Online Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”) comprise the “General Terms” and “Product Specific
            Terms” set forth below. All use of the electronic and online services offered by Wingate (together with its
            affiliates, “WAML” or “us”), including but not limited to the WAML WorldView® portal, any future release
            thereof or successor thereto, and all products and services accessible or made available through such portal
            (collectively, the “Online Services”), is subject to the General Terms. By using any of the Online Services,
            you are agreeing to the General Terms.
            <br><br>
            To the extent that you use any of our products or services made available through the Online Services
            specifically referenced below under “Product Specific Terms,” you are also agreeing to the applicable Terms
            set forth under that heading. In the event of a conflict between the General Terms and any applicable
            Product Specific Terms, the Product Specific Terms shall prevail. The terms of each separate agreement
            governing your business relationship with WAML (each, a “Client Agreement”) shall also apply to your use of
            the Online Services in connection with such relationship, and the Terms are hereby incorporated in their
            entirety into such Client Agreement by reference. Except where specifically provided to the contrary in the
            Terms, in the event of a conflict between the terms of the Terms and those of any applicable Client
            Agreement, the provisions of the Terms shall prevail.
            <br><br>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline">General Terms</strong>
            <br><br>
            <strong>1. ACCESS TO ONLINE SERVICES</strong>
            <br><br>
            1.1 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Security Credentials</span>. An identification code (“User ID”)
            and password(s) (“Password”) are required to
            access any of the Online Services. A digital certificate, an encryption key and/or other security devices
            may also be required, at WAML’s discretion, to access certain Online Services. You are responsible: (a) for
            the security and confidentiality of all User IDs, Passwords, digital certificates, encryption keys and other
            security devices (collectively, “Security Credentials”): (b) to safeguard your Security Credentials and not
            to give or make available, intentionally or otherwise, any of your Security Credentials to any unauthorized
            person; and (c) for all use of the Online Services through your Security Credentials, including
            transactional activity, whether or not such use is actually authorized by you. Should you elect to share
            your Security Credentials with a third party (including, without limitation, investment advisors and data
            aggregators), you will bear full responsibility and liability for all actions taken by such third parties
            through use of your Security Credentials, which we will be entitled to assume to be authorized by you. We
            will not be responsible for any breach of security, or for any unauthorized activity or theft by any third
            party, caused by your failure (be it intentional, unintentional, or negligent) to maintain the security or
            confidentiality of your Security Credentials. You must immediately notify us in writing if you believe that
            the security or confidentiality of any of your Security Credentials has been compromised, if you suspect
            unauthorized access to your account by means of the Online Services or otherwise, or if a person to whom a
            Security Credential has been assigned leaves your employment or is otherwise no longer permitted to access
            the Online Services on your behalf. An authorized person from your organization must communicate such
            notification to WAML by submitting a completed user access request form, which can be obtained from your
            organization’s relationship management contacts at WAML.
            <br><br>
            1.2 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Termination of Access</span>. We may terminate your access to
            the Online Services at any time, for any reason,
            with five (5) business days’ prior notice; provided that we may terminate your access to the Online Services
            with no prior notice if (a) your account with us is closed, (b) you fail to comply with any of these Terms,
            (c) we believe that your continued access to the Online Services poses a security risk, or (d) we believe
            that you are violating or have violated applicable laws, and we will not be liable for any loss you may
            experience as a result of such termination. You may terminate your access to the Online Services at any time
            by giving us ten (10) business days’ notice. Upon termination, we will cancel all of your Security
            Credentials and any in-process or pending Instructions (as defined in the applicable Client Agreement) will
            be carried out or cancelled, at our sole discretion.

            end use in the ordinary course of your business; this limited license does not authorize you to distribute
            such information to those outside your organization, either for compensation or for free, and you are
            expressly prohibited from doing so; provided, however, that you may distribute (a) normal business records
            maintained by us for you as your administrative agent (such as account information, fund administrative
            reports and similar financial information), if applicable, to the extent required by applicable law or
            business custom to be disclosed to regulators or shareholders or to advisors in connection therewith, and

            <strong>3. SOURCES OF INFORMATION</strong>
            <br><br>
            The information made available through the Online Services has been compiled from both internal and external
            sources. Such information may include quotes, news, and research data prepared by third parties and provided
            by us or obtained from sources we believe to be reliable, but we cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy,
            timeliness, or completeness of such information for any particular purpose. Such information is inherently
            subject to change without notice and may become dated. You agree that we will not be responsible for any
            loss you experience as a result of your reliance on such information. We use reasonable efforts to make sure
            that the information available through the Online Services is accurate and up-to-date. However, we do not
            represent or warrant that the information contained therein is accurate or complete, and you should
            therefore verify any information obtained through the Online Services before you act upon it. (“Third Party
            Terms and Conditions”) are applicable to your use and receipt of third party data and information available
            to you through the Online Services. Such Third Party Terms and Conditions are required by the relevant
            third-party data providers pursuant to our arrangements with them, and are incorporated herein by reference
            in their entirety.
            <br><br>
            <strong>4. USE IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS</strong>
            <br><br>
            We do not operate as a banking entity in all jurisdictions. The information made available through the
            Online Services is not intended for distribution to, or use by, any person or entity in any jurisdiction or
            country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us or
            any of our affiliates to any registration qualification, licensing, approval, or non-disapproval requirement
            within such jurisdiction or country. Some products and services may not be available in all jurisdictions or
            to all clients. By choosing to access these Online Services from any location other than the United States,
            you accept full responsibility for compliance with all local laws.
            <br><br>

            penalties, fines, obligations, or expenses of any kind (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys’,

            or any third party as a result.<br>
            (b) From time to time, the temporary unavailability of third party telecommunications or computer systems
            required by the Online Services may result in a delay in processing Instructions. In such an event, we shall
            not be liable to you or any third party for any Losses that you experience due to such a delay.
            <br><br>
            <strong>6. ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS</strong>

            THESE PRODUCTS ARE NOT DEPOSITS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF, AND ARE NOT GUARANTEED BY, US OR OUR AFFILIATES,

            7.2 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Internet Access</span>,
            <span style="text-decoration: underline">Email Communications</span>,
            <span style="text-decoration: underline">Prohibited Usage</span>.
            <br>
            (a) If you access the Online Services via the Internet (including, without limitation, through a mobile
            device), you will be required to use a third-party provided Internet browser, such as Firefox or Internet
            Explorer, Internet utility software from various software providers not affiliated with WAML, and/or a
            WAML-provided mobile application. Your use of such software to access the Online Services shall be at your
            own risk and shall be subject to terms and conditions imposed by WAML and such third parties in addition to
            these Terms (e.g., the Apple Licensed Application End User License Agreement). We do not warrant the
            performance of, and bear no responsibility for, your use of any third party information, software,
            telecommunications hardware, or Internet connection. Some Online Services may be accessed via a direct
            dial-up connection through software we provide to you; in those cases, your use of that software is subject
            to license terms included with the software for each Service. Such license terms, which include limitations
            with respect to liability, use and redistribution, are hereby expressly incorporated into these Terms. We
            are not responsible for any access costs you incur to connect to the Online Services.<br>
            (b) Your use of any third-party Internet links made available on the Online Services is at your own risk.
            The content to which you link has not been developed, checked for accuracy, or otherwise reviewed by us. We
            make no representations as to, and shall have no liability for, any third-party site, including without
            limitation, the accuracy, subject matter, quality, or timeliness of any electronic content.<br>
            (c) Because Internet electronic mail (“e-mail”) presents issues of reliability of delivery, content
            accuracy, timeliness, and security, you should not send us any personal or identifying information, such as
            account numbers, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, passwords, etc., via Internet e-mail. We will
            take reasonable security precautions to safeguard data and communications transported to us over the
            Internet; however, we disclaim any liability for interception of any such data or communications. You agree
            that you will not use e-mail to request, authorize, or effect the purchase or sale of any securities,
            currency, or commodities, to send funds transfers instructions, or for any other transactions unless we
            mutually agree on procedures by which all such e-mail communications from you can be transmitted in
            compliance with WAML’s applicable policies and procedures (e.g., Investor Services Client Email Instruction
            Policy). <br>
            (d) You are prohibited from deliberate misuse of any element of the Online Services, including, without
            limitation, hacking, disruption or excessive use or any use in contravention of applicable law, and making
            any modifications to the Online Services, including, without limitation, the software, information, formats,
            and interfaces that comprise the Online Services. You further acknowledge and agree that you will be
            responsible for the introduction, whether intentional or unintentional, of (i) any virus or other code,
            program, or sub-program that damages or interferes with the operation of the computer system containing the
            code, program or sub-program, or halts, disables, or interferes with the operation of the Online Services
            themselves; and (ii) any device, method, or token whose knowing or intended purpose is to permit any person
            to circumvent the normal security of the Online Services or the system containing the software code for the
            Online Services ((i) and (ii) collectively, “Malicious Code”). You agree to take all necessary actions and
            precautions to prevent the introduction and proliferation of any Malicious Code into those systems that
            interact with the Online Services. You will be held strictly liable for decreased effectiveness or
            efficiency of, or for any errors and omissions arising out of the use of, the Online Services provided to
            you or our other clients as a result of any violation of the foregoing.<br>
            (e) The risk profiling software which is a part of the Online Services is not being made available for the
            purpose of providing investment or other advice to you or any other party, and no information or material
            available on or through these Online Services is to be relied upon for the purpose of making or
            communicating investment or other decisions. Neither the information nor any opinion contained on these
            Online Services or any other web site, web page, online service or any other electronic service constitutes
            investment advice or a solicitation by us or our affiliates for the purchase or sale of any securities,
            futures, options or other financial instruments or a solicitation to provide any investment advice or
            service.
            <br><br>

            COMMUNICATION FAILURE, THEFT, DESTRUCTION, OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO ANY SERVER, RECORDS, PROGRAMS, OR
            SERVICES, WHETHER OR NOT LIMITED TO CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
            APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE, OUR AFFILIATES, OR OUR OR THEIR PARTNERS, PRINCIPALS, LICENSORS,
            SUPPLIERS, CONTRACTORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS, AND/OR EMPLOYEES BE LIABLE FOR ANY
            DAMAGES, WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
            CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE ONLINE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT
            TO THE THIRD PARTY MATERIALS, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE ONLINE SERVICES,

            DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUS, COMMUNICATION LINE FAILURE, OR LOSS OR MODIFICATION OF
            CONTENT OR DATA, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NO THIRD PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY RIGHT OR
            CLAIM UNDER THESE TERMS.

            at least fifteen (15) days in advance except when a shorter notice period is required, in which case we will
            provide you with as much prior notice as is reasonably possible under the circumstances. Continued use of
            the Online Services following the effective date of any such changes will be deemed your acceptance of and
