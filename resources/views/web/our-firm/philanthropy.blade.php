            At Wingate, it's good to share your time and talent.
            <br><br>
            Because of this, we created Cares, our philanthropic program dedicated to providing education and basic
            necessities to those in need. Through this program, Wingate Employees are able to give back to our
            communities and help transform the lives of others while inspiring a spirit of citizenship and social
            responsibility.
            <br><br>
