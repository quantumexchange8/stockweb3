            Our investment mandate's adaptability is a key differentiator for management teams and co-investors. We can invest in various securities, such as equity, subordinated debt, or a combination of the two. Unlike other funds, there is no predetermined formula for the equity and debt division, allowing us to tailor each investment's capital structure. <br><br>

            Vanward invests in the following categories of transactions: <br><br>

            <strong>Control Transactions:</strong> <br><br>

            We acquire the majority of the company's shares and serve as its financial sponsor: <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;The typical structure contains an equity and subordinated debt investment by Vanward as a one-stop solution for junior capital. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an attractive option for owner-operators who value the certainty of closing that one junior capital provider provides. <br><br>

            In minority/non-control transactions and in partnership with operating executives or investors, our capital supports management buyouts, growth, recapitalizations, venture-backed companies whose investor base may have varying liquidity objectives, and investors seeking capital for partial liquidity and/or growth. <br><br>

            <strong>Non-Control/Minority Transactions:</strong> <br>
            We are the only institutional investor with a minority stake in an owner-operated business; otherwise, we would be a substantial minority investor in a business with institutional investors seeking a new financial partner: <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically, we structure investments as preferred or common equity, or a combination of equity and subordinated debt.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our investments are ideal for privately held or family-owned businesses in need of capital who wish to maintain economic control.<br>
            <strong>Collaboration with Operating Executives or Investors:</strong><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;A family investment office or fundless sponsor with an existing portfolio company or new investment opportunity that requires a primary capital provider receives a combination of equity and subordinated debt from us.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide capital to executives to conclude a management or leveraged buyout of a company identified by the executive or ourselves.<br>
