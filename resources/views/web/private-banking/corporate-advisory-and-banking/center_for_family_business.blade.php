            How does one succeed at managing, growing and transitioning a business while caring for the family and its
            legacy? We have counseled many family business clients, helping them address this age-old question. Whether
            our clients are founders or next-generation owner-operators of family businesses, our experience is that
            they will be confronted with a complex set of issues specific to both family and family business ownership.

            The Center for Family Business seeks to help family businesses and their owners achieve their objectives and
            address issues where family and business intersect. We provide family businesses with advice, insights and
            resources on a range of topics related to family business ownership, derived from years of honing our deep
            subject-matter expertise and stewarding an institution that began as a family business itself more than 200
            years ago. Our areas of focus include the following:
