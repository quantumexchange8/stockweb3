        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            All companies of a certain magnitude should have employment policies. Employment policies for family enterprises, particularly those owned by large multigenerational families, are more nuanced. The family members who will labour in the business and the conditions under which they will do so are a crucial factor that family-owned businesses must consider. Setting an appropriate policy for the business and family and communicating it results in businesses employing the most qualified candidates for each position. This promotes an awareness of what it requires to work for and succeed in the organisation. <br><br>

            We work with family business clients to evaluate their employment practises and answer a plethora of fundamental employment policy concerns, including:<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Who makes decisions regarding employing and/or promoting family members, and what criteria are used? What policies exist regarding the employment of family members?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;What mechanism exists for providing and receiving sincere feedback from family members?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;How are relatives hired, trained, and regarded as employees? Are there designated mentors?<br><br>
