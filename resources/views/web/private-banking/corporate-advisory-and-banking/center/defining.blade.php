        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            Many successful families create legacies. In families that manage multigenerational family enterprises, legacy is frequently cultivated, enhanced, and passed down from one generation to the next. For family business proprietors, legacy goes beyond what it means to be a family member. It also encompasses the role that the family business performs for its employees and the communities in which it operates. <br><br>

            We collaborate with our clients to help them consider the most pertinent issues related to delineating their legacies and the future of their businesses, such as: <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;What is the vision of the current generation for the company in relation to future generations? Are the current and future generations in agreement with this vision?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;What is/are the purpose(s) of the family business? Why is the business owned by the family?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;What are the principal objectives of maintaining the family business? Is it establishing or preserving the family legacy? Providing jobs? Creating prosperity? Profiting the communities where the business operates?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;How is non-family ownership or management viewed?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;What values and principles should guide family and family-owned business decision-making?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;How did the family arrive at these values and guiding principles, and have they documented them?<br><br>
