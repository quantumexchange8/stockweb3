            Many family-owned enterprises have non-employee family members who own shares. Therefore, it is essential to establish and communicate policies for generating liquidity for shareholders. Family shareholders wish to know whether or not they will receive distributions and whether or not they can redeem or transfer their shares. They also desire a say in the inherent return expectations of share ownership. Successful businesses frequently extol the virtues of long-term ownership for family members and the value-enhancing effects of patient capital on the business and family over time. As a private company that has lasted for centuries, Vanward understands the delicate equilibrium between capital reinvestment and owner returns. <br><br>

            When working with family business clients on distribution and liquidity issues, we assist them in answering the following questions:<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;How have the family's expectations been established for returns and distributions? Is there consensus within the family?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;What mechanism is in place to facilitate the orderly redemption of shares? How are stocks valued and how frequently?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;What role does the family play in determining debt levels, risk parameters, etc. for the family business?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Do the current executives discuss liquidity with all shareholders in an open manner?<br><br>
