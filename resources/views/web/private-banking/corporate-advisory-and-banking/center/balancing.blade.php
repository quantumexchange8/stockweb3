        <h2>Balancing Competing Interests</h2>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            Most companies at some point face the challenge of balancing competing interests among stakeholders, and
            family businesses are unique in that the family is one of the key constituents. While competing interests
            may be inevitable, creating a protocol for addressing them and encouraging communication among all relevant
            groups is paramount to resolving issues. When consensus is unattainable, engaging outside parties to
            facilitate discussions and act as an objective sounding board can lead to resolution.

            When working with family businesses to address and balance competing interests, we discuss questions such
            as:<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;How is conflict typically handled within the family, concerning ownership
            and/or management of the business?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;What mediation practices have been developed for resolving conflicts?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;What has the family done in terms of engaging third parties to facilitate
            conflict resolution or improve communication and decision-making?<br><br>
