            Family businesses are unique in that the family is one of the key constituents, whereas the majority of companies confront the challenge of balancing competing stakeholder interests at some point. Even though competing interests may be unavoidable, establishing a protocol for addressing them and promoting communication between all relevant parties is essential for resolving problems. When consensus cannot be reached, bringing in outside parties to facilitate discussions and serve as an objective sounding board can result in a resolution.

            When assisting family enterprises in addressing and balancing competing interests, we discuss the following:<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;How are family disputes regarding the possession and/or management of the business typically resolved?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;What mediation techniques have been developed for conflict resolution?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;What steps has the family taken to engage third parties in order to facilitate conflict resolution and enhance communication and decision-making?<br><br>
