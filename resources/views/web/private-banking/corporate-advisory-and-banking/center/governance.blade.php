            The number of shareholders that span generations tends to increase as family businesses flourish over time. Frequently, the majority of family members who own shares do not labour for the company. However, as family members and shareholders, many are curious about the state of the business. In addition, they have the right to access shareholder information regarding their ownership stake and the performance of the company. Therefore, communication with family members who do not hold a position within the organisation is essential. Numerous family businesses seek objective external counsel from third parties or family members and form family advisory boards or boards of directors. The advantage of obtaining impartial counsel not only improves communication between family shareholders and the company, but it may also lead to greater productivity and happiness. <br><br>

            We work with family businesses to develop communication and governance structures, and we ask them to consider a number of crucial concerns, such as:<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Who determines the composition of the board of directors? How are directors selected, recruited, and authorised? How does the board of directors interact with the family owners?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;What considerations have owners given to establishing a family council (and possibly a family assembly) to organise family ownership and potentially represent the family on the board?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;What is the communications policy governing the sharing of company information within and without the family?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Does the family hold family meetings regularly? Who determines the attendees?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;How does the business involve family members who are not currently employed?
