        <h2>@lang('public.succession planning – management and ownership')</h2>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            The majority of long-lasting companies contemplate and plan for management succession. This topic can be especially relevant for family businesses, especially when the management is determining between multiple family members and a nonfamily member as the heir apparent CEO. Management succession for family businesses is typically more difficult because it must balance the traditional challenges of a successful plan with the family dynamics endemic to a family business. <br><br>

            Additionally, family businesses confront the challenge of ownership transition. In many instances, the next generation of proprietors may not work for the company, despite being shareholders. In the absence of a clear statement of long-term objectives and a carefully considered set of share ownership and transfer policies, this can lead to complications. <br><br>

            Vanward has worked with family-owned businesses for generations on management and ownership succession planning, and as a multigenerational partner-owned private business, we routinely consider this topic. When assisting our clients in developing solutions to their succession issues, we consider the following queries with them: <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;How does the current management and ownership model influence the performance of the next generation of family managers and owners upon transition? Nonfamily executives?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;What alternatives to succession planning are being considered, if any?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;What conversations have been held with the next generation regarding management and/or possession of the business? How are family members qualified for positions of leadership?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;How are decisions regarding leadership succession made? Are both family and non-family leaders conversant with the procedure?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Exists a method for educating and training future generations of owners/leaders?<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;What regulations govern stock ownership and ownership transfers?<br><br>
