        <h2>Capital Policies</h2>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            Capital policies are an important component of any business. For family businesses, these policies address
            important topics like allocation of capital, permissibility of raising equity and resultant ownership
            dilution, leverage, selling and redeeming shares and shareholder distributions. As a capital provider and
            advisor to family businesses for more than 200 years, and as a private company itself, WAML has a depth of
            expertise working with family businesses to frame these policies. <br><br>

            We work with family businesses to help answer essential questions related to capital policies, such as:
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;What is the process for assessing the capital needs of the business regularly?
            Who owns that process internally?
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;How does the business communicate those capital needs to the family ownership
            group?
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;How does this process dovetail with family distribution planning?<br><br>
