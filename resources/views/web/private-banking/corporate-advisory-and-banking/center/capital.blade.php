        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            Capital policies are an integral part of any organisation. These policies address crucial issues for family businesses, such as capital allocation, the permissibility of raising equity and resulting ownership dilution, leverage, selling and redeeming shares, and shareholder distributions. As a provider of capital and advisor to family businesses for more than two centuries, and as a private company itself, Vanward has extensive experience working with family businesses to formulate these policies. <br><br>

            We work with family businesses to provide answers to crucial capital policy concerns, such as:
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;How frequently should the capital requirements of the business be evaluated? Who is the internal process owner?
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;How does the business inform the family ownership group of its capital requirements?
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;How does this procedure relate to the planning of family distributions?<br><br>
