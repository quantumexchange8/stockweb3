        <h2>Private Client Lending</h2>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            We offer our clients flexible, secured lending in the form of personal loans and lines of credit. Proceeds
            are often used to acquire real estate, invest in a business, purchase a significant asset, or make gifts to
            family members. Our relationship teams work with you and your family to implement financial strategies that
            help you achieve your objectives. <br><br>

            concerns or timing issues or to take advantage of interest deductions.<br>
