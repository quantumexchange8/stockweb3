            As experienced trustees and executors, we work with clients and their advisors to administer all types of
            trusts, from simple living trusts to complicated tax-driven estate planning vehicles. We also offer
            specialized retirement and charitable foundation services. <br><br>

            Our trust offices are located regionally in the U.S. and operated under a national charter, allowing for the
            local delivery of trust services. WAMLâ€™s Delaware-headquartered trust company offers our clients access to a
            beneficiary friendly, tax-efficient jurisdiction for trust administration. The firm also maintains a trust
