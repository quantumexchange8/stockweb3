            Philanthropy can be a means of giving back, assisting others and your community, setting an example for your family, and/or leaving a legacy. Because philanthropy is so personal and unique to individuals and families, it typically involves a number of considerations on a variety of topics, such as articulating a mission and determining the best legal structure, as well as selecting grant recipients and assessing impact. <br><br>

            We assist our clients in addressing all aspects of their philanthropic plans and objectives, regardless of where they are in their philanthropic journey, so that they can have a positive and enduring impact on their causes, communities, and loved ones.
