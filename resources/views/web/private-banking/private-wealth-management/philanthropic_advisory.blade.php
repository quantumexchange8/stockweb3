        <h2>Philanthropic Advisory</h2>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            Philanthropy can be a way to give back, help others and your community, set an example for your family
            and/or leave a legacy. Because philanthropy is so personal and unique to individuals and families, it
            typically involves a number of considerations on a range of topics, from articulating a mission and
            identifying the best legal structure to selecting grant recipients and monitoring impact. <br><br>

            We help our clients address all elements of their philanthropic plans and goals, no matter where they are in
            their philanthropic journey, so that they can create a lasting and positive impact that supports their
            causes, communities and loved ones.
