        <h2>Investment Advisory</h2>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            Appropriate asset allocation is a critical element of your investment plan. We work
            with you to allocate your assets in accordance with your spending needs and desire to pass wealth on to
            future generations and philanthropic causes. The better we understand the intended uses of your wealth, the
            more accurately we can align your portfolio’s risk and expected return characteristics with your goals.
            <br><br>

            We implement your asset allocation through a combination of proprietary and third-party investment
            strategies anchored in one common objective—preserving and growing your wealth. All investment managers
            compete for inclusion on our platform, and in order to be considered, they must share our beliefs that
            purchasing securities at a discount to their valuation and knowing what you own and why are the best ways to
            protect and grow wealth over time. <br><br>

            <strong>Asset Allocation Process</strong><br><br>

            Wingate’s ("WAML") investment teams provide asset allocation recommendations for a range of client types,
            and our relationship teams use these recommendations as a starting point to combine our best thinking with
            investment and wealth planning advice tailored to the needs of you and your family. <br><br>

            <strong>Our Fundamental Investment Principles</strong><br>
            &bull;&nbsp;<strong>Active Management</strong>: We believe all markets are inherently inefficient and that
            through careful security
            selection, investors can generate excess returns with lower risk of permanent capital loss. <br>

            &bull;&nbsp;<strong>Bottom-Up Fundamental Research</strong>: We invest in strategies that conduct rigorous
            fundamental analysis to project each potential investment’s value. <br>

            &bull;&nbsp;<strong>Value Orientation</strong>: We seek strategies that invest in securities trading below
            our estimate of their intrinsic value,* which provides the portfolio a margin of safety.** <br>

            &bull;&nbsp;<strong>Long-Term Focus</strong>: We believe that the surest path to generating attractive
            investment returns is to patiently wait for the realization of an investment’s value without being swayed by
            short-term market volatility. <br>

            &bull;&nbsp;<strong>Unique View of Risk</strong>: We believe that the biggest threat to your financial
            health is not market volatility; it is the permanent loss of your capital. We believe market volatility
            provides opportunities to acquire high-quality assets at a discount to their valuation. <br>

            &bull;&nbsp;<strong>Discipline and Patience</strong>: We are patient investors. We hold cash when nothing
            meets our investment criteria, and we have the conviction to sell when an investment no longer offers
            acceptable returns relative to its potential for loss. <br><br>

            *Intrinsic value represents what we believe to be the value of a security based on our analysis of both
            tangible and intangible factors.
            **A margin of safety exists when we believe there is a significant discount to intrinsic value at the time
            of purchase – we aim to purchase at 75% of our estimate to intrinsic value or less. <br><br>
