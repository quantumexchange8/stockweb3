            The Center for Women and WealthÂ® (CW&W) is committed to engaging and supporting women as they create and
            manage wealth. We provide women with investment, planning and philanthropic resources derived from decades
            of experience through work with our private banking clients. The CW&W aims to cultivate a community, in
            person and online, where women can share experiences with each other and give advice to new generations of
            female leaders.

            CW&W is excited to partner with The Better Life Lab, an initiative at the think tank and civic enterprise
            New America. The Better Life Lab is a leader in the national conversation surrounding the evolution of
            gender roles and norms, family policy, and how we work and live. They are policy entrepreneurs finding
            outside-the-box solutions to public problems, and using research, data and reporting to inform their work
            and tell the stories that motivate, edify and engender change.
