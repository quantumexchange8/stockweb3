            The Centre for Women and WealthÂ® (CW&W) is committed to engaging and assisting women in the wealth creation and management processes. We provide women with investment, planning, and philanthropic resources derived from our private banking clients' decades of experience. The CW&W seeks to cultivate an in-person and online community where women can share their experiences and offer guidance to future generations of female leaders.
