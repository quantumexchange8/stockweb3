        <p>Our signature development programs are tailored to Vanward’s ("Vanward") unique culture, helping
            you as you progress in your career to grow as a leader, build long-term relationships, and
            navigate the global marketplace. Some programs are designed for specific points in your
            career, such as a promotion to management, while others employ a competitive selection
            process and are available throughout the year. Samplings of our offerings include:</p>
            <br>
        <p><strong>Development Assignment Program (DAP): </strong>Highly motivated individuals have the
            opportunity to grow their skill set and advance their careers with a two-year assignment in
            one of our international locations. Those selected for DAP rotate through a number of roles,
            working to broaden their understanding of our business while building key relationships,
            gaining global exposure to senior leaders, learning new skills, immersing themselves in a
            new culture, and sharing their knowledge with local teams. The program includes a
            combination of on-the-job experiences and classroom training. Participants enroll in formal
            training classes and are assigned a mentor.</p>
            <br>
        <p><strong>Foundations of Vanward Management:</strong> This cohort-based program targets new and/or
            recently promoted managers, ensuring they are equipped to lead a global and diverse
            workforce. The curriculum engages a variety of learning styles by blending self-led,
            classroom, and e-Learning while ensuring application back on the job. This development
            approach embeds the participant’s manager throughout the program, ensuring alignment between
            the firm’s expectations and a new manager’s day-to-day responsibilities.</p>
            <br>
        <p><strong>Leadership Education And Development: </strong>This two-year leadership
            commitment starts with a nine-week intensive program designed to help participants map their
            leadership journey, deepen their financial acumen, and contribute to Vanward’s strategic
            objectives. Employees deepen their self-awareness; create a personal leadership brand;
            succeed in large, complex assignments; and develop a network within the firm and the
            industry.</p>
            <br>
        <p><strong>Leadership Bridge: </strong>This is a six-month program for longer-term
            managers who have had limited or no formal management training. Similar to our foundations
            program, participants will develop the skills to harness the full power of their teams,
            including the ability to leverage and manage interpersonal differences, guide and coach
            their subordinates, and successfully navigate performance conversations.
