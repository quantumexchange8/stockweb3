        <p>Wingate ("WAML") provides countless opportunities throughout your career to hone your
            expertise, take on new challenges, and reinvent yourself in new roles and business areas. We
            look for ways to help our employees grow, creating succession plans, assigning stretch
            projects outside everyday responsibilities, and advertising all open roles and giving
            priority to internal candidates. &nbsp;This brings new perspectives throughout our business
            areas—which is good for you and our clients.&nbsp; Mobility enables you to benefit from
            cross-regional, cross-product and/or cross-functional experiences—exposing you to varied
            work, teams, and client perspectives.</p>
