            <br>
        <div style="padding-left: 30px;">
            <li>Performance Management: We emphasize frequent feedback and collaboration between you and your
                manager. Together, you will create a roadmap that outlines your career goals and the steps
                needed to achieve them. Our mid-year and year-end review processes ensure that you receive
                formal check-ins to track your progress and make any necessary adjustments.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Development Planning: We understand the importance of continuous learning and growth. Our
                development plans are designed to identify any skill gaps and provide you with a tailored plan
                to close them. This may include a combination of on-the-job experiences, formal learning
                programs (such as classroom or web-based training), and informal learning opportunities (such as
                participating in communities, reading articles, or books).</li>
                <br>
            <li>Mentoring: We recognize the value of guidance from experienced colleagues. Through our
                mentorship programs and discussion groups, you have the opportunity to connect with senior
                leaders and tap into their expertise. These mentoring relationships can provide valuable
                insights, advice, and support as you progress in your career.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Driving Your Career: Our structured e-Learning series, "Driving Your Career," is designed to
                help you create personalized development plans. This series enables you to identify the elements
                of an ideal career fit and evaluate different pathways to enhance your career satisfaction. By
                leveraging this resource, you can gain clarity on your professional aspirations and take steps
                towards achieving them.</li>
