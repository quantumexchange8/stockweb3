        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
        <p>While times have changed since we opened our doors, one thing that has remained constant is
            our commitment to our clients and core values. Bringing together people and capabilities to
            provide our clients with solutions to challenging problems is where we excel.&nbsp; Our
            unique culture emphasizes Teamwork, Integrity, and Excellence and these values drive our
            success.</p>
            <br>
        <p><strong>What TIEs Us Together</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Teamwork. Integrity. Excellence. What makes these values distinct at Vanward is how we bring
            them to life. Recently, we celebrated our core values by asking employees to share how they
            experience Teamwork, Integrity, and Excellence at Vanward. We heard countless stories:
            colleagues who went out of their way to help their teams; decisions made in the best
            interest of clients; times when we stuck to our principles even when our view was not
            popular; and leaders who inspired us by their commitment to our Values.&nbsp;</p>
            <br>
        <p>Though we have varied years of tenure, sit in 18 locations around the world, come from
            diverse backgrounds, and work in different lines of business, a common set of values unites
            our diverse points of view in service to our clients and to each other. Daily and frequent
            displays of our core values make Vanward a place our employees want to workâ€”and continue
            working, which helps us to build lasting, transparent, and meaningful relationships.</p>
