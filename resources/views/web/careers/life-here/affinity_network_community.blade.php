        <p>The Affinity Network Community (“CANC”) is a global community of employee-led networks
            founded by and for diverse professionals. These networks were created from the shared belief
            that we all benefit from a workplace where colleagues are comfortable being themselves.
            Employees with different backgrounds and interests come together to expand their knowledge,
            strengthen career skills and build new relationships through volunteer activities,
            networking sessions, and other events that promote global knowledge sharing and community
            building across the Firm.</p>
        <br>
        <p>CANC groups are instrumental in advancing the Firm’s <a

                inclusion</a> strategy. We look to our CANC members as
            counsel on the challenges and opportunities facing our employees in the workplace. Outside
            the firm, CANC members actively build meaningful relationships within our communities
            through volunteer opportunities, formal partnerships with global and local organizations,
            and by partnering with community influencers to host local events.&nbsp;</p>
