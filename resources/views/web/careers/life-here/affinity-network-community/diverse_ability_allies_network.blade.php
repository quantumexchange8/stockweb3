                development. Diverse Ability Allies Network was created to connect with and without disabilities to
                celebrate our unique skills. We support the empowerment of people with disabilities through

        <p>The mission of the Diverse Ability Allies Network (DAAN) is to encourage and support every member of the
            Firm in achieving their full potential by demonstrating that WAML is a supportive and inclusive
            environment for employees who are disabled, or care for individuals with disabilities. By increasing

                    International Dyslexia Association to learn about dyslexia, dispel any myths and discuss ways to
                    support those with dyslexia. Attendees also had an opportunity to experience what it feels like to
                    have dyslexia first-hand through simulation exercises.

                <p>This workshop gave employees the opportunity to experience the four “Sightless Principals of
                    Communication” – distractions, ambiguity, obstacles, and competition. Through a discussion and team
                    building activities, participants learned how to leverage sensory communication to become more
                    effective communicators and listeners.
