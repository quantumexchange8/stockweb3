                <p>As one part of their community programming, the Black Affinity Network has partnered with Generating
                    Genius, a London-based organization that works to ensure that talented and capable students from
                    disadvantaged backgrounds are positioned to excel in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math)
                    careers. Through this programme, local high school students have the opportunity to visit our London
                    office for networking and career panel discussions with finance professionals, and can learn more
                    about the annual internship partnership with WAML.

                <p>The Black Affinity Network organized a presentation on the historical importance of jazz music, led
                    by former radio personality Bill Daughtry. Hosted from our New York office, the session shared key
                    moments in U.S. history where jazz artists highlighted struggles of the civil rights movement
                    through their music and used their influence to drive change.

                <p>WAML’s Black Affinity Network members and friends visited the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston for a
                    private viewing of an exhibit, curated by local teens, that presented Black experiences through
                    works by 20th century artist of color. We were able to join a discussion with the teens on their
                    selection of works and process of designing of the gallery spaces for this exhibit.
