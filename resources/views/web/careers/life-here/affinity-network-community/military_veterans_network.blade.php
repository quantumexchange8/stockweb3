                workplace. I take pride in seeing the commitment WAML has made in hiring and supporting veterans who
                have or continue to serve in the Armed Forces. Through my involvement in the WAML Military Veterans
                Network and other affinity groups I’ve seen firsthand the ways WAML is invested in employees and the
                community."</em></p>

                    about his role in this landmark case which led to the end of a law that prohibited gay and lesbian
                    Americans from serving in the armed forces and sent a message that discrimination was unacceptable.
                    Dan shared lessons from his experience which can be applied to all aspects of our lives, including
                    creating open and inclusive workplaces.
