        <p><em>“I’m proud to be part of the Pride Network and be part of a Firm where LGBTQ professionals and
                supporters have a community of peers to come together for sharing, networking, and volunteering. The
                greater our diversity and inclusion, the more we unlock human potential and the greater the
                prosperity of WAML. Having a diverse set of colleagues who feel comfortable being themselves is our
                culture in tangible and intangible ways.” </em></p>

        <br>
        <p>WAML believes everyone should feel empowered to bring their whole selves to work regardless of sexual
            orientation or gender identity. The Pride Network creates a welcoming community for employees who
            identify as LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or questioning) and their allies. Through
            education and advocacy, we raise awareness of topics relevant to the LGBTQ community, helping to create
            a diverse, accepting, and inclusive workplace. Members benefit from professional development
            opportunities, including a formalized mentoring program and targeted volunteerism to give back to local
            communities. We also partner with our Lines of Business to ensure policies and practices are sensitive
            to, and inclusive of, LGBTQ professionals.</p>

                <p>The WAML Pride Network presented award-winning transgender storyteller, diversity speaker, educator,
                    and Ted Talk Presenter, Scott Turner Schofield, whose presentation touched on themes of "gender
                    diversity," identity, culture, language, and ally-ship. Scott's presentation included transgender
                    themes and introduced the concept of "inter-sectionality" — answering the question of how biological
                    sex, gender, and sexuality are influenced by factors including race, socioeconomic status,
                    geographical location, and disability. Scott masterfully wove these topics together, speaking to
                    audience members' varied experiences, both in and out of the workplace.
