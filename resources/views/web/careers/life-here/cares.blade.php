        <p>WAML has a proud tradition of volunteer service. In fact, giving back is so ingrained in our
            culture that we created Cares, a philanthropic program dedicated to providing education and
            basic necessities to those in need. Entirely employee-driven, Cares’ activities are
            sponsored by the Firm and spearheaded by volunteers whose passion infuses energy into each
            initiative. Through partnerships with non-profits, we provide opportunities for employees to
            learn about the issues facing our communities and how to be part of the solution.</p>

        <p><strong>Our Focus Areas: Basic Needs and Education</strong></p>

        <p>Our philanthropic focus areas promote stability and aim to foster long-term success.
            Providing basic needs—food, clothing, and shelter—and supporting educational programs
            enables individuals and families to take control of their finances, gain independence, and
            achieve economic sustainability.&nbsp;</p>
