            The increasing complexity of capital markets, investment products, and the regulatory environment
            necessitates greater clarity and a real-time view into investment activity. There is a premium associated
            with timely decision making across trading, risk, product and marketing front office stakeholders.

            <strong>Antiquated Status Quo</strong>
            <br><br>
            Asset gatherers have built strong franchises on the backs of order management systems (OMS) and Accounting
            Data (ABOR), but the idea of maintaining the OMS/ABOR status quo is antiquated and filled with gaps.
            <br><br>
            Advancing from the OMS/ABOR solution to a holistic investment book of records (IBOR) that is optimized for
            today’s investment environment is a complex but vital undertaking. A consistent book of records provides a
            framework to assess the current state of an asset gatherer’s Data Governance Strategy and formulate
            enhancements.
            <br><br>
            <strong>IBOR Strategy</strong>
            <br><br>
            The front office seeks information on real-time cash, securities and known future securities’ events across
            all their asset classes – such as public and private equity, and derivatives — through various exposure
            linkages and across a global network of brokers and custodian frameworks. For asset gatherers, a successful
            IBOR strategy consists of the following components:
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Data Governance Strategy <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Data Capture<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Aggregation and Enrichment<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Information Delivery<br>
            <br>
            WAML provides market insight into these components to help clients shape their data governance strategies.
            Our technology platform provides an enterprise-wide data repository for consistent data capture across
            service providers, and aggregates and enriches data in a meaningful manner. This allows us to power client
            enterprise data hubs to enable better front office decision making.
