            InfoNAV® is a scalable, independent, secondary NAV calculation tool which enables asset managers to monitor
            the NAV production process across all their administrators. The application provides clients with
            transparency into their global array of products, geographies and accounting providers.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Understanding the Impact</strong>
            <br><br>
            Clients can efficiently document control and apply an oversight best practice to their various accounting
            providers. InfoNAV® imports critical NAV component data from our clients’ service providers and generates a
            secondary NAV for comparison to the primary NAV. Clients can then easily obtain key metrics, analytics and
            reporting for Boards and interested parties via the dashboard.
