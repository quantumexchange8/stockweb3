            Vanward Account Operator enables our global financial institution clients to gain direct access to US
            central securities depositories leveraging Vanward as a technology and service provider.
            <br><br>
            Clients maintain operational control over their US assets, acting as a direct depository participant and
            reducing third party risk. Clients can become more competitive in the US market allowing them to increase
            global reach. Direct market participation is available without the investment in local market infrastructure
            and staffing expertise, providing a quicker time to market than an internal build.
            <br><br>
            Account Operator includes Vanwardâ€™s integrated business continuity planning and risk management programs that
            are currently servicing the largest and most sophisticated institutions in the world.
