            alternatives, we are adept in dealing with the structural and operational requirements typical to these
            types of funds.

            We have dedicated expert hedge fund teams who leverage our core competencies to deliver the institutional
            standards and capacity of a global bank, combined with the service quality of a specialist administrator.
            <br><br>
            <a href="javascript:goTo('globalServiceModel')">Our global service model</a> allows us to adapt our
            servicing to the needs of the manager, locating teams in the different time zones and domiciles required.
            <br><br>
            We put a particular focus on shareholder onboarding and ongoing servicing, knowing that this is fundamental
            in ensuring an asset manager’s reputation with its underlying clients. As such this helps build and protect
            brand - an increasingly important driver of a manager’s distribution strategy.
