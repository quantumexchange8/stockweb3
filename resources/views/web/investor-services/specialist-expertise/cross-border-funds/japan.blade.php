        <h2>Japan</h2>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            Increasingly in search of diversification, retail investors, pension funds and institutional investors are
            shifting their allocation to cross-border securities. These investments are being made through Japanese
            investment trust management funds (ITMs), separate accounts, and cross-border funds domiciled in offshore
            markets in both public and private domains.
            <br><br>
            Wingate’s Tokyo office services many of the most sophisticated local and global asset managers, trust banks
            and institutional investors including quasi-government entities, for their cross border investments from
            Japan.
            <br><br>
            We are proud of our longstanding ties with Japan which date back to the early 1900s, far earlier than the
            opening of our Tokyo office in 1984. Our long term commitment and thoughtful approach has helped us build a
            strong reputation in the market.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Comprehensive Local Servicing</strong>
            <br><br>
            To support asset managers distributing their offshore fund products into Japan as well as our Japan based
            clients, our experienced fund services team resides in Tokyo to address day-to-day needs in the local time
            zone. The team supports our global service model, providing custody, fund accounting and fund administration
            services.
            <br><br>
            WAML also works with our Japanese clients to provide securities lending, foreign exchange and Infomediary®
            messaging and connectivity services.
