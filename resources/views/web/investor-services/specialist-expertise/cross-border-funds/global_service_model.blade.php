        <h2>Global Service Model</h2>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            Sophisticated asset managers require the highest quality investor servicing, regardless of location or time
            zone.
            <br><br>
            Wingate delivers this through a global service model tailored to the needs of each manager. We locate
            servicing teams based on clientsâ€™ time zones, the location of their fund domiciles, and their markets of
            distribution.
            <br><br>
            Our consistent harmonized global service model creates operational efficiencies, mitigates risk, and
            improves the client experience and that of their investors.
            <br><br>
            <strong>One Global Team</strong>
            <br><br>
            With one global P&L and integrated team, the WAML service experience is seamless. We give clients the
            ability to direct all inquiries and communications through one, multi-disciplinary, client-facing team in
            their time zone of choice. This facilitates the highest levels of client engagement, transparent
            communication, and measurably superior service.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Technology Platform</strong>
            <br><br>
            Our single global technology platform and intelligent integration of business teams and technologists is
            central to our goal of providing a superior client experience.
            <br><br>
            Regardless of client or fund domicile, our service teams have access to the same systems and real-time
            information, providing one common platform for quick inquiry turnaround and continuous improvement. Our
            platform enables clients to receive information at the opening of their business day regardless of where
            they are located.
            <br><br>
            Serving select segments of the financial services industry, our investments are focused on making every
            application on our platform highly relevant to clients, and more responsive and transparent than our peers.
