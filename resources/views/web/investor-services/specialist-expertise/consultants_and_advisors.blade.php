        <h2>Consultants & Advisors</h2>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            Consultants and advisors are playing an increasingly significant role in our clientsâ€™ strategic
            decision-making processes, as well as in our own engagement with the industry.
            <br><br>
            Wingate has built a discipline around consultant and advisor engagement with two main goals:
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ensure consultants and advisors have the tools they need to help their clients meet their changing and
            evolving needs. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To provide a forum for exchanging industry insights and information around capabilities, expertise and
            services.
