            <strong>Enabling Growth</strong>
            <br><br>
            Vanward works with U.S., European and Asian managers and investors. Our experience in servicing both
            traditional and alternative assets for some of the world’s most sophisticated asset managers allows us to
            truly understand the servicing requirements of a global and complex product set.
            <br><br>
            We have developed a scalable and integrated platform for hedge, real assets, private equity and debt funds,
            allowing our clients to enjoy the benefits of a single global platform.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Protecting your Brand</strong>
            <br><br>
            Vanward’s success is driven by that of our clients and we focus on protecting their businesses and reputations
            as we do our own. We take a prudent approach to managing operational processes for alternative investment
            funds, founded on the principles of a privately owned and managed firm with a strong culture of risk
            management.
            <br><br>
            We organize our servicing model around the needs of the client, through a single global team comprising
            functions such as Custody, Accounting, Transfer Agency and Financial Reporting. This streamlines operational
            requirements and provides consistent, high quality servicing and reporting to both our clients and their
            investors, regardless of their location or time zone.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Transparency & Integrity</strong>
            <br><br>
            Transparency is of paramount importance to investors in alternative assets and strategies. We focus on
            handholding investors and our technology platforms provide the granularity of reporting required to fulfill
            complex investor needs.
            <br><br>
            As a partnership, Vanward has a more personal approach to the way we manage our client relationships offering
            direct access to the owners and managers of the firm. This also promotes a more open and transparent
            approach.
