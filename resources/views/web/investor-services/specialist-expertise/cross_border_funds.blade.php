            <br><br>
            Our offering is based on three core principles:
            <br><br>
            <strong>Brand Protection</strong>
            <br><br>
            Brand is an increasingly important driver of a manager’s distribution strategy.
            <br><br>
            Our organizational structure has allowed us to develop a unique global service model. Through a single
            global technology platform and interconnected global teams we design our servicing capabilities around the
            domicile of the fund, location of the investment manager, and the markets of distribution.
            <br><br>
            We focus on supporting underlying clients’ needs locally and protecting and enhancing their brand globally.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Managing Complexity</strong>
            <br><br>
            Supporting some of the most sophisticated asset managers in the world, many of whom distribute in more than
            20 global markets and multiple time zones, we understand the complexity of servicing cross-border product
            ranges.
            <br><br>
            Our focus and expertise helps clients navigate the regulations and product trends which impact cross-border
            distribution. Our global service model, supported by a single global technology platform creates a powerful
            infrastructure to enable our clients to sell their funds globally.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Investment in Clients’ Growth</strong>
            <br><br>
            As a privately managed organization which is committed to cross-border fund servicing as a long term growth
            market, we are able to invest in our clients’ growth over the long-term.
            <br><br>
            Through key investments in people, infrastructure and technology, we provide the framework to help our
            clients meet their growth objectives both now and in the future.
