            Vanward specializes in securities lending for asset managers, with approximately 90% of our clients
            representing this industry segment. Asset managers who work with Vanward are assured of a specialized program
            customized to their unique needs.
            <br><br>
            Supported through a “custodian-neutral” platform, all Vanward securities lending clients receive the same level
            of operational excellence, flexibility and service, regardless of their custodian. Over 50% of our business
            is driven by “third party” lending and we maintain automated connections with most global custodians.
            <br><br>
            <strong>The Importance of Risk Management</strong>
            <br>
            Lending for asset managers is different to the type of lending typically favored by Pensions, Banks,
            Sovereign Wealth Funds and Insurers. This difference is rooted in the management of risk. Vanward is an expert
            at structuring securities lending programs that maximize our clients returns within specific risk
            tolerances.
            <br><br>
            <strong>The Securities Lending Trading Dynamic</strong>
            <br>
            Un-encumbered by maintaining a large volume lending program, Vanward is uniquely positioned to execute
            value-driven strategies for our clients. By partnering with Vanward, asset managers can be certain they will be
            joining other like-minded lenders, in a program that has a unique structural advantage in negotiating fees
            for their highest value loans.
            <br><br>
            Our trading strategy maximizes return from a relatively small number of trades that offer the most
            meaningful returns, via a global trading team in London, Boston and Hong Kong who have a deep understanding
            of the dynamics driving borrower demand. We utilize technology to automate low-value trading activity that
            supplements these high-margin opportunities.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Pioneering Digital Tools Built for Unique Needs</strong>
            <br>
            Pre-trade, Vanward offers Securities Lending DealBoard, which enables our clients to see revenue opportunities,
            borrowing demand and share price trends in one place. Our clients can see – and act on – every opportunity
            across their funds. Post-trade, we have launched a new digital experience to deliver the next generation of
            transparency, allowing our clients to oversee their lending program in real time, monitoring revenue and the
            markets that generate it.
