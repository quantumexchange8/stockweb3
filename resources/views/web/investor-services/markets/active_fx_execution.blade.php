                Disclaimer: Using extensive input from dealers, publicly available sources, and their own research,
                Greenwich Associates identifies the largest and most active institutional foreign exchange customers around
                the world, including fund managers, customer banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, and corporations.
                <br><br>
                For the 2017 study, Greenwich Associates conducted interviews with 2,355 users of foreign exchange globally,
                of which 1,458 are top-tier accounts, at large corporations and financial institutions. In the United
                States, Greenwich Associates interviewed 383 FX users, of which 292 were Top-Tier. To be considered top
                tier, a firm must be either a central bank, a government agency, a hedge fund, a fund manager, a FT100
                global firm, a firm with reported trading volume of more than $10 billion, or a firm with reported sales of
                more than $5 billion. Interviews were conducted in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Japan
                between September and November 2014. The findings reported to clients reflect solely the views reported to
                Greenwich Associates by the research participants. They do not represent opinions or endorsements by
                Greenwich Associates or its staff. Interviewees may be asked about their use of and demand for financial
                products and services and about investment practices in relevant financial markets. Greenwich Associates
                compiles the data received, conducts statistical analysis and reviews for presentation purposes in order to
                produce the final results.
                <br><br>
                Each of these clients is targeted for an interview either in-person or on the telephone by one of Greenwich
                Associates professional Executive Interviewers.
                <br><br>
                During the interview, clients respond to a series of detailed qualitative and quantitative questions about
                the dealers they use for various FX products, and these dealers’ relative strengths and weaknesses in sales,
                market making, research, and back office. Clients also provide detailed information about their trading
                activities, their current and expected product use, dealer selection criteria, and other market-related
                issues.
                <br><br>
                Based on the results of the interviews, Greenwich Associates creates a series of comparative metrics related
                to market penetration and market share; service quality in sales, research, and trading; and effectiveness
                of e-trading.
