        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            Wingate's InfoFX® is a dynamic foreign exchange alternative to traditional operational FX management that
            offers the ease of a low-touch solution with the insight and flexibility of an in-house desk in freely
            traded and select restricted markets.
            <br><br>
            Created specifically for asset managers, InfoFX offers a fully automated, WAML-hosted approach built around
            execution quality, operational efficiency, comprehensive reporting and the control to make real-time
            decisions.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Operational Efficiency</strong>
            <br><br>
            InfoFX automatically calculates FX trade requirements based on security settlement details, and offers
            netting and aggregation functionalities where applicable. Operational and settlement risk can be minimized
            through our proprietary messaging platform, WAML
            <a href="javascript:goTo('dataConnectivityAndApplicationsViaInfomediary')">Infomediary</a>®.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Choice through Control</strong>
            <br><br>
            Through our interactive platform, clients have the ability to schedule or change execution times for select
            markets and address potential trade errors before they may occur.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Restricted Markets Expertise</strong>
            <br><br>
            Our local market expertise can provide helpful insights to clients who choose to execute away from their
            custodians in markets previously thought to be custodian-captive. InfoFX currently supports six restricted
            markets: Brazil, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand.
            <br><br>
            <strong>360° Transparency</strong>
            <br><br>
            InfoFX clients can view real-time net pre-trade exposure, detailed pre-trade order information and
            post-trade analytics through an interactive online platform. We provide clients with relevant time stamps
            and reference rates so that they may assess execution quality and provide the option to configure customized
            reports.
