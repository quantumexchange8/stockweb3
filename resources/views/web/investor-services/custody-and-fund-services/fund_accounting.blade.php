            Wingate ("WAML") is a private equity strategy that provides highly customized, one-stop junior capital
            solutions to lower middle‐market companies. We currently have committed capital of approximately $1.1
            billion that is available to be invested. <br><br>

            WAML invests between $10 million and $125 million in businesses with enterprise values of $10 million to
            $500 million and can invest substantially more by partnering with strategic co-investors or through
            co-investments from our limited partners. We focus our investments in the healthcare, technology, media and
            telecommunications, and business products and services industries. Our capital supports a range of
            transactions, from buyouts and growth equity to recapitalizations and acquisitions. <br><br>

            <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Benefits of Wingate as a Partner</span></strong><br><br>

            <strong>The WAML Advantage</strong><br><br>

            WAML utilizes WAML’s extensive global network to provide its portfolio companies with a wide array of
            benefits, including access to new customer/vendor relationships, introductions to potential acquisition
            targets, and assistance with implementing improved information systems.<br><br>

            <strong>Flexible Mandate</strong><br><br>

            Our flexible investment mandate gives us the ability to act as a control or non-control investor and to
            structure our investments as a combination of equity and subordinated debt securities. This flexibility is
            differentiated in that it provides WAML with the ability to structure investments that are specific to the
            needs of each opportunity.
