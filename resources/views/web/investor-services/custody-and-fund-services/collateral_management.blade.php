            Disruption to the derivatives market is underway as regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Act, European Market
            Infrastructure Regulation, and Basel III increase the scarcity of available collateral. This has intensified
            focus on improving collateral management practices as a means to increase operational effectiveness,
            decrease counterparty credit risk, and control the costs of trading and collateralizing swaps. The way asset
            managers adapt their collateral management discipline will impact their ability to deliver investment
            performance.
