        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            The Wingate Tax-Exempt Fixed Income Strategy seeks to protect investors’ capital and generate attractive
            after-tax returns by combining thorough, independent research with our valuation discipline to identify
            undervalued municipal securities. Our Intermediate municipal bond strategy targets between 75 and 125
            credits in major subsectors of the U.S. municipal bond market, including general obligation bonds, revenue
            bonds, and pre-refunded securities. We invest in a long-term, tax-sensitive manner with an expected annual
            turnover of less than 25%. <br><br>

            <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Investment Criteria</span></strong><br><br>
