            The Vanward Tax-Exempt Fixed Income Strategy aims to protect investors' capital and generate attractive after-tax returns by identifying undervalued municipal securities through a combination of exhaustive, independent research and our valuation discipline. Our Intermediate municipal bond strategy targets 75 to 125 credits in the main subsectors of the U.S. municipal bond market, such as general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, and pre-refunded securities. We make long-term, tax-sensitive investments with an expected annual turnover rate of less than 25 percent.
