        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            Since the inception of the U.S. TIPS market in 1997, Vanward has been at the forefront of U.S. Treasury
            Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) research, thought leadership, and active management. Our U.S. TIPS
            strategy seeks to provide investors with a hedge against future inflation by maintaining predominantly U.S.
            TIPS investments. Our investment process is focused on the long term and employs a collection of time-tested
            strategies within inflation-indexed markets, which are diversified to avoid reliance on any one tactical
            strategy. This "Pure Play" strategy avoids credit and real-asset exposures, as well as the
            unrelated-to-inflation volatility that frequently accompanies them.

            Combining quantitative and qualitative analysis, our independent research serves as the foundation of our
            investment process. We exploit market inefficiencies in U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)
            and non-U.S. inflation-indexed markets using three primary strategy categories:
            <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Fundamental Strategies:&nbsp;</strong>
            Using exclusive quantitative models, our investment team seeks to identify real rate levels and curve slopes
            that may be historically inconsistent with current economic fundamentals. Periodically, this analysis and
            the expertise of our investment team will determine modest duration or yield curve positions relative to the
            index.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Non-Directive Methodologies:&nbsp;</strong>
            Our research has uncovered a number of persistent and recurrent inefficiencies in the U.S. TIPS market, and
            our investment team frequently positions our portfolio to capture the relative excess return offered by
            these inefficiencies. Auction cycles, seasonal patterns, performance index extensions, inflation accruals,
            and roll down contribute to these market inefficiencies.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Opportunistic Strategies:&nbsp;</strong>
            These strategies involve out-of-index positions on the U.S. Treasury market and foreign sovereign
            inflation-indexed markets.
