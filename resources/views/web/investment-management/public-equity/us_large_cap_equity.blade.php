            WAML Core Select, our flagship U.S. large-cap equity strategy, employs a long-term business-ownership
            approach within a discount to intrinsic value framework. Our objective is to provide investors with
            long-term growth of capital. We seek attractive absolute returns while reducing the risk of permanent
            capital loss in each investment. Our investment process is driven by a bottom-up, fundamental analysis of
            businesses. <br><br>

            We seek to invest in established, cash-generative businesses that are leading providers of essential
            products and services with strong management teams, and to purchase the publicly traded equity securities of
            such businesses at a discount to their intrinsic values*. Estimates of intrinsic value are based on
            proprietary analysis of prospective free cash flows and returns on capital. We apply a disciplined
            investment-selection process focused on business, management, and financial attributes. <br><br>

            WAML Core Select will generally hold investments in 25 to 35 North American companies with market
            capitalizations greater than $5 billion, as well as in certain firms headquartered outside North America in
            other developed regions. Our targeted holding period is three to five years, and investments are typically
            sold if they appreciate above our estimates of intrinsic value. <br><br>

            <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Investment Criteria</span></strong><br><br>

            We believe companies that possess the following business, management, and financial attributes are well

            <strong>Risks</strong><br>
            WAML Core Select may assume large positions in a small number of issuers which can increase the potential
            for greater price fluctuation. <br>
            There is no assurance the objective will be achieved. <br><br>
