            Vanward Core Select, our primary U.S. large-cap equity strategy, utilises a discount to intrinsic value
            framework and a long-term business ownership approach. Our goal is to provide investors with long-term
            capital appreciation. In each investment, we pursue attractive absolute returns while minimising the risk of
            permanent capital loss. Our investment process is driven by a fundamental, bottom-up analysis of companies.
            <br><br>

            We aim to invest in established, cash-generating businesses that are the leading providers of essential
            products and services and have strong management teams, and to acquire the publicly traded equity securities
            of these businesses at a discount to their intrinsic values*. Estimates of intrinsic value are derived from
            an analysis of prospective free cash flows and capital returns. We employ a methodical investment selection
            procedure centred on business, management, and financial characteristics.
            <br><br>

            Vanward Core Select will typically hold investments in 25 to 35 North American companies with market
            capitalizations greater than $5 billion, in addition to certain companies domiciled in other developed
            regions. Our target holding period is between three and five years, and investments are typically sold if
            their price appreciation exceeds our estimates of their intrinsic value.
