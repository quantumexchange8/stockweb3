            WAML Global Core Select, our global equity strategy, employs a long-term business-ownership approach within
            a discount to intrinsic value framework. We search for established, cash-generative, well-managed businesses
            that are leading providers of essential products and services, and we seek to purchase publicly traded
            equity securities of such businesses at a discount to their intrinsic values*. Estimates of intrinsic value
            are based on proprietary analysis of prospective free cash flows and returns on capital. We apply a
            disciplined investment-selection process focused on business, management, and financial attributes. <br><br>

            WAML Global Core Select will generally hold investments in 30 to 40 U.S. and non-U.S. companies with market
            capitalizations greater than $3 billion; we seek to own a minimum of 40% non-U.S. companies in the
            portfolio. The targeted holding period is three to five years, and investments are typically sold if they
            appreciate above our estimates of intrinsic value. <br><br>

            <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Investment Criteria</span></strong><br><br>
