            Vanward Global Core Select, our global equity strategy, employs a discount to intrinsic value framework with
            a long-term business ownership approach. We seek to acquire publicly traded equity securities of
            established, cash-generating, well-managed businesses that are prominent providers of essential products and
            services at a discount to their intrinsic values*. Estimates of intrinsic value are derived from an analysis
            of prospective free cash flows and capital returns. We employ a methodical investment selection procedure
            centred on business, management, and financial characteristics.
            <br><br>

            Vanward Global Core Select will typically hold investments in 30 to 40 U.S. and non-U.S. companies with
            market capitalizations greater than $3 billion; we aim to own at least 40% non-U.S. companies. The target
            holding period is between three and five years, and investments are typically sold if their price
            appreciation exceeds our estimates of their intrinsic value.
