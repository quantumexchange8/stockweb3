        <h2>U.S. Small & Mid-Cap Equity</h2>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            Wingate's ("WAML") Small-to Mid-Cap Equity invests in a select number of out-of-favor and/or under-followed
            small- and mid-cap companies without using leverage or shorting. The strategy invests in eight to 15
            companies typically with a long-term, three-to-five year horizon. Investments are typically sold if they
            appreciate above estimated intrinsic value*. <br><br>

            We maintain a disciplined investment process and use demanding criteria to select a group of well-positioned
            companies that are trading at a substantial discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We perform
            extensive due diligence on each portfolio company and we concentrate investments in companies and industries
            we know and understand, including information services and software, outsourced business services, cable
            television and programming, manufacturers or distributors of consumer products, and financial services.
            After we make an investment, we monitor it through ongoing discussions with industry participants and an
            active dialogue with the company’s management team. <br><br>

            <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Investment Criteria</span></strong><br><br>

                shareholders over its remaining life. <br>
                -The strategy may assume large positions in a small number of issuers, which can increase the potential
                for greater price fluctuation. <br>
