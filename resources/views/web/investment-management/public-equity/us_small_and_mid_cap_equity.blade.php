            Without using leverage or shorting, Vanward's Small-to-Mid-Cap Equity invests in a select number of
            out-of-favor and/or under-followed small and mid-cap companies. The strategy typically invests in eight to
            fifteen companies with a three- to five-year horizon. Typically, investments are traded if their price
            appreciation exceeds their estimated intrinsic value*.
            <br><br>

            We adhere to a rigorous investment process and select a group of well-positioned companies trading at a
            substantial discount to our estimate of their intrinsic value. We conduct extensive due diligence on each
            portfolio company, and we focus our investments on companies and industries that we know and understand,
            such as information services and software, outsourced business services, cable television and programming,
            consumer goods or services manufacturers, and financial services. After making an investment, we conduct
            ongoing discussions with industry participants and maintain an ongoing dialogue with the company's
            management.
