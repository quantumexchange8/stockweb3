            Vanward's mission is to be the greatest at long-term capital preservation and growth for our clients.
            Vanward ("Vanward") has conducted its own investment research with a concentration on the long-term
            preservation of capital and the prudent management of risk in relation to return. At the core of our
            investment process has always been the understanding that loss avoidance is the key to generating superior
            long-term investment returns.
            <br><br>

            We believe that incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria into our investment
            process improves our ability to manage risk and attain long-term goals. We believe that environmental,
            social, and governance (ESG) criteria are integral to our equity and fixed income investment processes.
            <br><br>

            Our investment strategy explicitly incorporates ESG criteria and is governed by a set of fundamental
            principles that are applied to the entirety of our investment portfolios. Together, they constitute a
            tried-and-true strategy that has established long-lasting client relationships and set us apart from our
            competitors.
            <br><br>

            Our investment principles: <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;concentrate on asset preservation

            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;conduct fundamental, bottom-up research<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Invest with a long-term outlook<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Be resolute and patient
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;adopt a value-based strategy
            <br><br>

            The evaluation of ESG factors as part of our investment research process enables us to effectively evaluate
            the long-term sustainability and resilience of our companies and credits:
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Environmental – Entities that are judicious with their use of resources,
            cognizant of climate risks, and appropriately conscientious of their environmental impact may gain
            efficiencies that contribute to their profitability. They are also less likely to incur unanticipated
            liabilities that can diminish enterprise value.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Social – Maintaining high standards for internal and external conduct can
            assist organisations in establishing robust cultures, generating improved long-term results for all
            stakeholders, and limiting adverse regulatory action.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Analysing the quality of management teams, governance structures, and the
            framework of rules, practises, and incentives under which organisations operate are fundamental components
            of long-term viability. Our view is that well-managed businesses, whose management teams behave like owners,
            are more likely to manage resources efficiently, create long-term value for shareholders, safeguard creditor
            rights, and maintain access to credit markets. These are essential qualities of the enterprises we choose to
            own for our clients.
            <br><br>

            ESG Integration: Integral to our bottom-up strategy:
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Our team of roughly 50 equity and fixed income investment professionals is
            responsible for integrating critical ESG criteria into our investment analysis and decision-making process.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Each of our investment teams utilises a strategy-specific approach that is
            consistent with our investment philosophy and procedure.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;We commit to a thorough investigation of factors that could result in capital
            impairment. As with any other potential risk, if ESG-related risks are not adequately addressed and
            mitigated, it may influence our decision with regard to that security.

            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;Through our bottom-up research on companies and industries, robust engagement
            with management and issuers, and ongoing efforts to monitor the regulatory and governmental environment, we
            perpetually enhance our understanding of how well ESG factors are managed.

            <br><br>

            criteria are thoroughly incorporated into our investment procedure. We have the ability to tailor investment
